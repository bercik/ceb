Script to check elective basis.

To run this script you have to create file named .user_info.txt in main folder. This file is added to .gitignore so don't worry about sending your passwords and login when u want to commit some changes. The file should have the following structure:

*login your_elective_base_login  
password your_elective_base_password  
email_address your_email_address   
email_password your_email_password*
